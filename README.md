Project Overview
The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) project aims to optimize the routes of electric vehicles (EVs) while considering specific constraints related to energy consumption, battery capacity, and the availability of charging stations. This project leverages mathematical and algorithmic approaches to find the most efficient routes for EVs, reducing travel time, energy usage, and costs while ensuring that the vehicle's energy limitations are respected.

Problem Definition
The EVRP is a variant of the classic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with the following key differences:

Energy Constraints: EVs have limited battery capacity and need to visit charging stations during long routes.
Recharging Times: Charging times may vary depending on the location and type of the charging station.
Energy Consumption: Varies depending on distance traveled and other factors such as load and terrain.
The objective is to minimize the total distance or cost while ensuring that the energy constraints of the electric vehicles are met.

Features
Route Optimization: Calculates the most efficient route for a fleet of electric vehicles, considering energy constraints and charging station availability.
Charging Station Integration: Automatically incorporates charging stops along the route when necessary.
Dynamic Energy Calculation: Accounts for varying energy consumption based on route characteristics.
Visualization: Provides map-based visualizations of routes and charging stations using Matplotlib and Folium.
